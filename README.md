# 🚀 Project Overview

This capstone Power BI project analyzes electricity consumption, billing, and revenue recovery across 5,000+ customers for a fictional utility company.
The primary analytical challenge was to validate management’s claim that **postpaid customers in the South region were responsible for poor revenue recovery**.

The report includes:

* 8 interconnected dashboard pages
* 15+ custom DAX measures
* Data modeling with relationships, hierarchies, and composite models
* Advanced analytics (rolling averages, YTD, drill-through, what-if simulation)
* Enterprise-grade features including RLS, incremental refresh & PowerApps integration

# 🧱 Data Architecture & Modeling

The solution integrates multiple datasets connected to PowerBI via google sheets:

| Dataset                         | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Electricity_Consumption.csv** | kWh usage by customer, month, meter type, region  |
| **Billing_Payment.csv**         | Amount billed, amount paid, outstanding revenue   |

# 🎯 Capstone Analytical Challenge (Management Claim)

### **Claim:**

“Postpaid customers are responsible for poor revenue recovery in the South region.”

### **Findings:**

The data disproved the hypothesis:

* **Postpaid recovery rate:** **81.95%**
* **Prepaid recovery rate:** **82.00%**
* **Key driver:** Prepaid customers accounted for **₦1.04M (65.44%)** of total outstanding revenue.
* **Regional patterns** showed no statistically meaningful underperformance by postpaid customers in the South.

### **Supporting Visuals:**

<img width="1919" height="911" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-21 090726" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c4bdd11-aeeb-44c9-a914-d71b81921c58" />

* Recovery Rate for Postpaid Customers in South Region
* Recovery Rate for Prepaid Customers in South Region
* Outstanding Revenue by Meter Type (Prepaid/Postpaid)
* Overall Recovery Rate 

### **DAX Measures (examples):**

```DAX
Recovery Rate for Prepaid = CALCULATE([Recovery Rate (%)],Electricity_Consumption[Meter Type]="Prepaid",'Electricity_Consumption'[Region]="South")
```

```DAX
Recovery Rate for Postpaid = CALCULATE([Recovery Rate (%)],Electricity_Consumption[Meter Type]="Postpaid",'Electricity_Consumption'[Region]="South")
```

### **Recommendation:**

Implement an automated follow-up system targeted at **prepaid customers**, since they generate the majority of outstanding revenue. Integrate SMS reminders, auto-blocking rules for persistent debtors, and tariff insights from the What-If parameter to guide price adjustments. This provides a more accurate intervention than focusing on postpaid customers, who are not the root cause of low recovery.
